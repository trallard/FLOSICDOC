NRLMOL_INPUTS 
==================================

The **NRLMOL_INPUT.DAT** is an auxillary input file that allows setting of paramaters for calculation.  If it doesnot exist then the it will be 
created during the run using default values.

The NRLMOL_INPUT.DAT with default values of parameters as of today (December 09, 2013) is given below. They are described in detail.


.. literalinclude:: input_files/nrlmolinput.file


Here **N** means *NO*. If **Y** then the calculation of a given property is requested. Note that certain calculations such 
as, for example, the calculation of joint density of states is often useful only at the final converged geometry.

    #. ATOMSPHV :  Default is **N**. 
       THis will place an atomic sphere around each nuclueus and integrates electron density within the sphere. 
       THis is a sort of population analysis and can be used to obtain local magnetic moment.

    #. CALCTYPEV:   Default is 'LBFGS'. Available choices:  **SCF-ONLY**, **CONJUGATE-GRADIENT**, **INTERNAL**, **POLARIZABILITY**

               *  **SCF-ONLY** for the SCF calculations, t
               *  **Polarizability** for the Polarizability by finite-field using energies.
               *  **CONJUGATE-GRADIENT** : Geometry optimization by conjugate-gradient.
               *  **INTERNAL** : Geometry optimization by internal-coordinates.
               *  **VERLET**   : Geometry optimization by VERLET.
 

    #. DIAG1V        = 0   ! diagonalization to use on regular arrays (diagge.f90)
           The diagonalization of matrices.
            0)  DSGVX (LAPACKL: computes selected eigenvalues, and optionally eigenvectors). This is default and only a few eigenvectors are obtained.
            1)  DSGVD (Default if matrix size is below 100).  Uses a divide and conquer algorithm to compute eigenvectors. 
            2)  DSGV   (This is slowest of the available) option.


    #. DIAG2V        = 0   
       Diagonalization of Hamiltonian (using packed storage for memory savings). Set using **idiag2** variable in the code.
       Note that the old Dirk's signular value decomposition rotuine for the diagonalization has been removed. It is very very slow compared
       to any of the following. 

          Available: 
           
            0)  DSPGVX (LAPACKL: computes selected eigenvalues, and optionally eigenvectors). This is default and only a few eigenvectors are obtained.
            1)  DSPGVD (Default if matrix size is below 100).  Uses a divide and conquer algorithm to compute eigenvectors. 
            2)  DSPGV   (QR- factorization. This is slowest of the available) option.  

          The option 1 (DSPGVD) is the fastest if all eigenvectors are required otherwise use the default 0.


    #. DOSOCCUV      = 'N' ! Controls wether to calculate density of states

    #. EXCITEDV      = 'N' ! Determines if this is an excited state calculation

    #. FORMFAKV      = 'N' ! this controls if FORMFAK is executed


    #. JNTDOSV       = 'N' ! this controls whether excite is executed (Calculation of joint density of states).


    #. MATDIPOLEV    = 'N' !  
       Set this to true during the site-specific polarizability. This will compute contributio to the 
       dipole moment from individual atom. This is particularly useful in computation of site-specific
       polarizabilities.
       It will by itself not provide site-specific polarizability.


    #. NONSCFV       = 'N' ! Set to Y to do a non SCF calculation

    #. DFTD3V        = 'N' ! Set to Y to do include Grimmes DFT-D3 dispersion
       This will include Stefan Grimme's empirical dispersion correction. The parameters set used 
       for the dispersion  in the NRLMOL is  set for the PBE functional. Also, the
       zero damping scheme is used by default. Use these for optimization of non-bonded systems. 
       For details, please refer to 
       S. Grimme, J. Antony, S. Ehrlich, and H. Krieg, J. Chem. Phys. 132, 154104 (2010); DOI:10.1063/1.3382344.

    #. NONSCFFORCESV = 'N' ! Set to **Y** to calculate forces in a non SCF calculation
       This will do a non SCF calculation. Not very useful. Sometimes you already have converged wavefunctions
       and you want to calculate the JOINT DOS or any post convergence property. Then it is recommended that you 
       perform at least one SCF iteration and compute the properties of interest.

    #. WFGRIDV       = 'N'  !
       When set to **Y**, it will generate CUBE file for 5 molecular orbitals densities around the HOMO and LUMO.
