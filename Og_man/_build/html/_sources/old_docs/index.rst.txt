Features 
============================================================== 


NRLMOL, the Naval Research Laboratory Molecular Orbital Library is a  massively parallel code for 
electronic structure calculations on large molecules and clusters. The code is based on Kohn-Sham 
formulation of density functional theory and solves Kohn-Sham equations by expressing the Kohn-Sham 
orbitals as a linear combination of Gaussian orbitals.  NRLMOL is  principally 
developed by Mark Pederson and collaborators.

Some of the features of NRLMOL or the things that you can do with NRLMOL.

Use of full point group symmetry- you can specify the symmetry operations

Full or partial structure optimization using Cartesian or internal coordinates  

Vibrational frequencies

Infra-red spectra 

Raman spectra

Density of States

Projected density of states

Vibrational density of states

Polarizability

Vibrational Polarizability 

Magnetic anisotropy

Spin Hamiltonians 

Site specific polarizabilities

Perturbative Delta SCF for the charge transfer excitations

Fragment Analysis 

Population analysis - MESP 

Population analysis - AIM 

Population analysis - NBO (interface to NBO)
