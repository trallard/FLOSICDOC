FLOSIC Documentation
====================

This is the source code for FLOSIC's updated documentation. Some updates include:
- Changed file layout
- Updated Information
- Better formatting for Code examples
     
## How to Compile:

You will need the *Sphinx* documentation generator and the *PyData* theme. You can install them with pip (Python >= 3.7),
    
    $ pip install Sphinx pydata-sphinx-theme

Once you have these installed, you should be able to compile the documentation (see recipes in Makefile for different formats). To build the html output:
     
     $ make html

The **html** target will build the output into the `BUILDDIR` variable, which is set to **_build**.

## Updating the Documentation:

Sphinx uses the reSructuredText markup language. Reference can be found here: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html

## Future Updates:

- Have a concrete list of additions to make, and aim to have it done by the end of the Summer 2023.
- Have more suggestions in the issues tab.
- Have more complex tutorials.
- Have a Reference section with algorithms,units, and more detailed input/output descriptions used in the software.
